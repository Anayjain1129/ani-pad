### Why did I make it?
As I already made hackpad So i wanna make sure that this submission is not hackpad
This is a easier project for highway. So, i made this project cause I use a 60% keeb which does not have a numpad and I really needed that so i asked alex can i make one and got a yes so here we go

### What was the hardest part about this ?
I had tons of issues with making the Firmware, I was really fucked up on Firmware part but I made through.

Features:

- EC11 Rotary Encoder - For Volume, Brightness etc
- 17x keys
- XIAO rp2040
- Traditional Numpad Layout
- QMK firmware

## Total Pricing 

This Numpad comes out to be 6887 INR ($80.36) When ordering all the parts I'm not including  the 3D parts because I will be getting them from Print Legion.

## Notes :-

I want all the three 3D-printed parts to be printed in black color.
The pricing might slightly vary due to flash sales, and dollar market trends.
